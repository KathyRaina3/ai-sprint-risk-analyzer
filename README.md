# AI-Powered Sprint Risk & Blocker Analyzer

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates how Generative AI can assist Technical Program Managers (TPMs) in proactively identifying delivery risks, cross-team dependencies, and potential release blockers within engineering sprint updates.

In large-scale engineering environments, TPMs often manually review dozens of status updates to detect issues. This prototype simulates an AI-assisted risk detection system designed to improve early visibility, reduce reporting overhead, and enhance delivery predictability.

## Business Problem

Engineering teams update tickets in tools such as Jira, internal dashboards, or sprint trackers.

Common challenges:

- Risks identified too late
- Dependency issues across teams
- Manual status scanning by TPMs
- Escalations occurring after impact
- Lack of structured executive summaries

This creates delivery uncertainty and increased program management overhead.

---

## Proposed Solution

This prototype models an AI-driven system that:

- Analyzes sprint update text
- Detects risk signals and blocker language
- Classifies risk categories
- Highlights cross-team dependencies
- Generates structured summaries for leadership

The goal is to simulate how Gen AI can support TPM decision-making workflows.

## Expected Impact (Prototype Simulation)

Based on modeled workflow improvements, such a system could:

- Reduce manual sprint review time by ~30–40%
- Improve early risk detection
- Increase cross-team visibility
- Enable proactive escalation
- Improve release predictability

---

## Project Scope

This repository includes:

- Sample sprint update dataset
- Risk classification logic (Python-based prototype)
- Structured TPM-focused documentation
- Framework for future AI integration

---

## Future Enhancements

- LLM API integration for contextual risk reasoning
- Dashboard visualization
- Jira API simulation
- Risk trend analytics
- Automated executive summary generation
